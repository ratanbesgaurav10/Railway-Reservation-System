# Railway-Reservation-System
Railway Reservation System is designed using *C++*.
* It is based on the concept of reserving train tickets for various destinations.
* In this project, separate login is created for admin and users where admin login is password protected.
* Admin can create, add, delete and update the trains and passengers can book or cancel the train only if the train is added by admin.
* Users must be created from the Admin mode for the first time then can reuse the same user after they have been developed, and they will be saved in separate files.
